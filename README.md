# Retail Sales Forecasting

This project aims to predict future retail sales using historical sales data and machine learning techniques. The focus is on using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting to help retailers optimize inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies.

## Features

- **Sales Forecasting**: Predict future sales using the ARIMA model.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore and analyze historical sales data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate the ARIMA model for sales forecasting.
- **Visualization**: Visualize sales trends, ARIMA model performance, and forecasting results.
- **Web Interface**: Provide a Flask-based web interface to input historical data and view forecasts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask (for web application interface)
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA model)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-sales-forecasting.git
   cd retail-sales-forecasting
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Set up environment variables if needed.

## Usage

### Data Analysis

1. **Load and Explore Data**:
   - Load historical sales data and perform exploratory data analysis to understand sales patterns.
   - Analyze seasonal trends, sales peaks, and other relevant patterns.

2. **Preprocess Data**:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Predictive Modeling

1. **Train ARIMA Model**:
   - Implement and train the ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
   - Perform model diagnostics and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

2. **Evaluate Model**:
   - Evaluate the ARIMA model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

### Running the Flask Application

1. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface for inputting historical sales data and viewing forecasts.

## Code Overview

- **app.py**: Main Flask application script.
  - **index()**: Renders the main page.
  - **forecast()**: Handles forecasting based on user input.

- **model.py**: Contains ARIMA model implementation and evaluation.
  - **train_arima_model()**: Trains the ARIMA model on historical sales data.
  - **evaluate_model()**: Evaluates model performance.
  - **predict_sales()**: Predicts future sales based on the ARIMA model.

- **data_preprocessing.py**: Handles data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.

## Configuration

- **MODEL_PATH**: Path to the trained model file if loading from disk.
- **FLASK_APP_PORT**: Port for the Flask application (default: 5000).
